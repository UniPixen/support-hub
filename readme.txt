This will import your messages from Facebook, Twitter, bbPress, Envato and more into an easy to use "support inbox".

== Description ==

This plugin will import all your Support Questions from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, POP3/IMAP Email, bbPress Forum Posts, WordPress Comments and Envato Item Comments into an easy to use "support inbox".

Here you can quickly see and reply to all your messages no matter what medium they come through.

This is the Support System you need when you already have a Support System. A great way to give Support Staff access to various social networks without giving them access.

More platforms will be added (e.g. ticksy, helpscout and zendesk are planned) along with some sample code so you can add your own 3rd party support system.

directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
